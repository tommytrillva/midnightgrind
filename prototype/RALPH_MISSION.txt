🏁 MIDNIGHT GRIND - 500 ITERATION AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT SESSION

Read design docs in ../docs/design/ (GDD.md, VehicleSystems.md, MultiplayerSystems.md)
Current Status: Stage 59 MVP Complete - 183 subsystems in Source/MidnightGrind/, 292 .cpp files, 293 .h files

PROJECT: Unreal Engine 5 street racing game - PS1/PS2 retro aesthetic, deep car culture simulation

MISSION: Systematically enhance existing systems and implement missing features from GDD specifications

DEVELOPMENT PHASES:

PHASE 1 (Iterations 1-100): EXPLORATION & PLANNING
- Read all design documentation thoroughly
- Explore Source/MidnightGrind/ subsystem architecture
- Map current implementation vs GDD vision
- Identify high-priority gaps and enhancements
- Document findings in DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md
- Create prioritized task list

PHASE 2 (Iterations 101-250): CORE SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS
- Vehicle physics refinement (handling model, drift mechanics, grip simulation)
- Customization system depth (ensure 200+ parts interact correctly)
- Pink slip race mechanics (implement permanent loss system properly)
- Economy balancing (cash flow, part pricing, progression curve)
- AI racing intelligence (racing lines, overtaking behavior, difficulty scaling)
- Police/heat system polish (escalation mechanics, escape dynamics)

PHASE 3 (Iterations 251-400): FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION
- Crew system (formation, management, benefits)
- Meet spot social features (gathering, challenges, reputation)
- Player-driven marketplace (buying/selling parts, cars)
- Tournament system (brackets, rewards, ranking)
- Career mode depth (story progression, boss races)
- Weather effects on physics (rain handling, visibility)
- Traffic AI improvements (realistic behaviors, interactions)

PHASE 4 (Iterations 401-500): POLISH & OPTIMIZATION
- Performance profiling (identify bottlenecks)
- Memory optimization (reduce allocations, fix leaks)
- Code cleanup and refactoring (remove duplication, improve structure)
- Comprehensive inline documentation (Doxygen comments)
- Unit test coverage (critical systems)
- Build validation (ensure everything compiles)
- Integration testing (subsystem interactions)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Coding Standards:
- Follow Unreal Engine 5 C++ coding conventions
- Use UPROPERTY/UFUNCTION macros appropriately
- Maintain const correctness throughout
- Use smart pointers (TSharedPtr, TWeakPtr, TWeakObjectPtr)
- Add UE_LOG statements for important events
- Include null checks before all pointer dereferences
- Add FORCEINLINE for performance-critical functions
- Use proper Unreal naming conventions (U/A/F/E prefixes)

Documentation Requirements:
- /** Doxygen-style */ comments for all public functions
- Explain WHY not just WHAT in complex logic
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Note performance considerations
- Add usage examples for complex APIs
- Update header comments when changing interfaces

Git Commit Standards:
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Format: "feat: description" / "fix: description" / "perf: description" / "docs: description"
- Atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- Reference GDD sections when implementing specified features
- Include before/after context in commit messages

SUCCESS METRICS (All Required):

✓ 50+ meaningful code enhancements across subsystems
✓ All changes compile without errors or warnings
✓ Comprehensive inline documentation added
✓ Performance maintained or improved (no regressions)
✓ 20+ clean git commits with clear messages
✓ No functional regressions in existing features
✓ Features align with GDD specifications
✓ Code follows UE5 best practices

PRIORITY RANKING (High to Low):

1. Vehicle physics (core gameplay foundation)
2. Pink slip race mechanics (unique selling point)
3. 200+ parts customization system (depth feature)
4. AI racing intelligence (player experience quality)
5. Economy balance (progression feel)
6. Police/heat system polish (tension and stakes)
7. Crew/social features (community building)
8. Meet spot implementation (social hub)
9. Weather physics effects (environmental depth)
10. Traffic AI behaviors (world immersion)

CHECKPOINT PROTOCOL:

Every 50 iterations, create PROGRESS_ITERATION_[N].md containing:
- Summary of work completed
- Key accomplishments and improvements
- Current focus area
- Next priorities
- Any blockers or concerns
- Performance notes

PROBLEM RESOLUTION:

If you encounter build errors:
- Document the specific error clearly
- Propose multiple solution approaches
- Add TODO comments for complex issues requiring manual review
- Continue with other improvements while blocked

If unclear about design intent:
- Reference GDD for vision alignment
- Default to "authentic PS1/PS2 arcade racer" aesthetic
- Prioritize "meaningful stakes" and "real ownership" pillars
- Consult VehicleSystems.md for technical depth questions

If performance concerns arise:
- Profile before optimizing (use UE Insights, stat commands)
- Document performance-critical code paths
- Add profiling markers (SCOPE_CYCLE_COUNTER)
- Measure before and after optimization

COMPLETION CRITERIA:

Output the phrase: MIDNIGHT_GRIND_LEGENDARY

When all of the following are true:
- All success metrics have been met
- Code is production-quality and well-documented
- Comprehensive documentation is in place
- No critical bugs or blockers remain
- Ready for senior developer code review
- You've created something truly legendary

GO ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. MAKE MAGIC HAPPEN. THE RACING COMMUNITY IS COUNTING ON THIS.

This is your chance to contribute to something special. Let's build a legendary racing game. 🏎️💨🌃✨
